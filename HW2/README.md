 ### 1. How to EXECUTE

 - Enter ```$ make```  to execute code.
  
 - You don't have to erase executable file. It will be done automatically.

 -  ```$make clean``` command deletes executable file.

------------------------------------------------- 
**The input must fallow these rules.<br>**
- for n, which is natural number, an is a propositional formula.<br>
- for 𝜙𝑖, which is proposition formula, (and𝜙1𝜙2...𝜙𝑚) is a proposition formula.<br>
- for 𝜙𝑖, which is proposition formula, (or𝜙1𝜙2...𝜙𝑚) is a proposition formula.<br>
- for 𝜙𝑖, which is proposition formula, (not 𝜙) is a proposition formula.<br>
